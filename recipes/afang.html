    <p>Afang soup with fufu</p>
    <p>Afang Soup recipe at long last… Yay!!! Afang Soup is one of the most popular traditional Nigerian soups. It is very nutritious, medicinal and native to the Efik people of Nigeria. This is one recipe I’ve wanted to post for months but I just couldn’t get my hands on fresh Periwinkles. Yes, I wanted it to be the real deal, anyway, I had to give up in the end as there was no chance of getting any, however well I tried.

    <h4>Ingredients:</h4>
    <li>
        <li>1kg Assorted meats (Beef, Smoked Turkey, Goat meat, Shaki, Ponmo, Cow leg are ideal)</li>
        <li>4 Bunches of Water leaves</li>
        <li>3 Cups Okazi/ Afang leaves</li>
        <li>2 Cooking Spoons Palm Oil</li>

<li>1-2 Pieces Smoked Fish</li>

<li>3 Pieces Stockfish</li>

<li>2 Cups Periwinkles with or without the Shells on</li>

<li>1-2 cooking spoons fresh ground Scotch Bonnet pepper</li>

<li>1 Cooking Spoon Crayfish Powder</li>

<li>2 Knorr Chicken Cubes</li>

<li>1 Maggi Crayfish</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Boil the meats on high heat, starting with tougher meats first. Offals may be boiled separately if they are bloody. </li>
        <li>Add salt and Knorr Chicken Cubes and seasoning, onions are optional, I don’t use any. I gather onions aren’t needed when preparing authentic Afang soup.</li>
        <li>When the meats are almost soft, add the Smoked fish and continue to boil till very soft</li>
        <li>While the meats are cooking, get the leaves ready.</li>
        <li>Slice and wash the Water leaves to remove all traces of dirt. Also wash and soak the Okazi/ Afang leaves in hot water for 2 minutes. This process will help soften the Afang leaves. Then transfer the Afang leaves into a blender, add a small amount of water, then blend to your preferred consistency. You may also Pound or grind the Afang leaves.</li>
        <li>Soak the smoked Catfish in hot water, clean to remove traces of dirt then shred and set aside.  When the meats are well cooked, you should end up with 1-2 Cups of Stock. To this, add the Crayfish, blended pepper, Smoked Prawns,  Smoked Fish, Maggi Crayfish and Periwinkles if you’re using any. Turn the heat down to medium. Leave to cook for 3-5. minutes.</li>
        <li>Now, add the washed Water leaves, stir and combine. Then leave to cook for 2-3 minutes. The Water leaves will wilt in the soup as it’s got quite a lot of water contents, do not be tempted to add too much. Remember we’ll still be adding Afang leaves.</li>
        <li>Now, add the Palm oil, stir and combine, leave to cook for 3 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add the blended Okazi/ Afang leaves, stir and combine, leave to cook for 5 minutes or until the leaves are tender enough for you. Taste for seasoning at this time and adjust if necessary.</li>
        <li>Switch the heat off and let it simmer with the residual heat for another minute or two.</li>
